# üè• Patient Management System ‚Äì Microservices-Based Healthcare Platform

> A production-ready, cloud-native Patient Management System built using Java Spring Boot, Docker, Kafka, gRPC, and AWS infrastructure tools. This project showcases my understanding of distributed systems, microservices, secure authentication, and scalable cloud deployments.

## üìå Project Overview

This Patient Management System is built using a **microservices architecture**, where each service (Patient, Billing, Notification, Auth, Analytics) performs a single business function. It is designed to be modular, scalable, and fault-tolerant.

**Communication:**
- gRPC ‚Üí For internal service communication  
- Kafka ‚Üí For asynchronous event-driven architecture  

**Deployment:**
- AWS ECS (Elastic Container Service)  
- RDS for relational DBs  
- MSK for Kafka messaging  
- API Gateway for routing and authentication  
- Infrastructure as Code with AWS CloudFormation and LocalStack for testing

## üèóÔ∏è Build Process Highlights

The system was built incrementally using IntelliJ IDEA and Docker, following a modular design with Spring Boot and cloud-native practices.

### üîß Patient Service
- Created `Patient` entity with JPA annotations, validation, and a PostgreSQL-backed repository.
- Built RESTful APIs with DTOs, error handling, and validation.
- Integrated gRPC client for communication with Billing Service.
- Produced Kafka messages on patient creation.
- Used H2 for local testing and PostgreSQL in Docker for production.
- Dockerized with a multi-stage build.
- Config files: [`/patient-service/Dockerfile`](./patient-service/Dockerfile), [`application.properties`](./patient-service/src/main/resources/application.properties)

### üí∞ Billing Service
- Defined `billing_service.proto` and generated code using `protobuf-maven-plugin`.
- Implemented gRPC server handling `CreateBillingAccount` requests.
- Dockerized with HTTP and gRPC ports exposed.
- Config files: [`/billing-service/Dockerfile`](./billing-service/Dockerfile), [`pom.xml`](./billing-service/pom.xml)

### üìä Analytics Service
- Subscribed to Kafka `patient-events` topic.
- Parsed protobuf messages and logged events for future metrics.
- Dockerized and configured with Kafka bootstrap servers.
- Files: [`/analytics-service/Dockerfile`](./analytics-service/Dockerfile), [`application.properties`](./analytics-service/src/main/resources/application.properties)

### üîê Auth Service
- Implemented login and token validation using JWT.
- Connected to PostgreSQL via Docker with seed data.
- Password encoding with Spring Security.
- Exposed endpoints: `/auth/login`, `/auth/validate`
- Dockerized and connected via API Gateway.
- Files: [`/auth-service/Dockerfile`](./auth-service/Dockerfile), [`application.yml`](./auth-service/src/main/resources/application.yml)

### üåê API Gateway
- Spring Cloud Gateway routes traffic to underlying services.
- Added custom `JwtValidationGatewayFilterFactory` for secure JWT validation.
- Separated dev (`application.yml`) and production (`application-prod.yml`) configurations.
- Files: [`/api-gateway/application.yml`](./api-gateway/src/main/resources/application.yml), [`JwtValidationGatewayFilterFactory.java`](./api-gateway/src/main/java/com/gateway/JwtValidationGatewayFilterFactory.java)

### üß™ Testing & Integration
- Created `integration-test` Maven module.
- Used RestAssured and JUnit to test both patient and auth endpoints.
- Verified unauthorized/authorized flows with API Gateway and JWT.

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Infrastructure with LocalStack
- Created Java CDK project under `/infrastructure`.
- Defined CloudFormation stacks for:
  - VPC
  - RDS (PostgreSQL)
  - MSK (Kafka)
  - ECS cluster and services
  - Application Load Balancer and Gateway
- Deployed with AWS CLI pointing to LocalStack.
- Files: [`/infrastructure/LocalStack.java`](./infrastructure/src/main/java/com/pm/stack/LocalStack.java), [`localstack.template.json`](./infrastructure/templates/)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Variables

Each service has its own `.env` or `application.yml` file. Example for Patient Service:

```env
SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL=jdbc:postgresql://patient-service-db:5432/db
SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME=admin_user
SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD=password
SPRING_KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS=kafka:9092
SPRING_JPA_HIBERNATE_DDL_AUTO=update
SPRING_SQL_INIT_MODE=always
````
